This site is an interactive table of exoplanets that allows for filtering based on the data types specified in the table. download the files and run on visual studio. you need to have Node installed and use the command "npm install" in the terminal. Then in the same terminal type "npm run dev -- -- port 8000" that will make a live server using one of you ports to run the application.

When using the application you can look for specific planets with the search and filter based on the columns by interacting with the table specifically.
